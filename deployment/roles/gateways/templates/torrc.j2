## Lines that begin with "## " try to explain what's going on. Lines
## that begin with just "#" are disabled commands: you can enable them
## by removing the "#" symbol.
##
## See 'man tor', or https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html,

## Tor will look for this file in various places based on your platform:

## Tor opens a SOCKS proxy on port 9050 by default -- even if you don't
## configure one below. Set "SOCKSPort 0" if you plan to run Tor only
## as a relay, and not make any local application connections yourself.
SOCKSPort 0

############### This section is just for location-hidden services ###

## Once you have configured a hidden service, you can look at the
## contents of the file ".../hidden_service/hostname" for the address
## to tell people.
##
## HiddenServicePort x y:z says to redirect requests on port x to the
## address y:z.

## SSH connection via Tor
HiddenServiceDir /home/{{ ansible_user }}/tor
HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22

{% if tor_http == true %}
## Test connection via default page on nginx
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80
{% endif %}
